**OpenAI Codex** is an AI model developed by OpenAI, based on GPT-3 and fine-tuned specifically for programming tasks. Hereâ€™s a summary:

### ðŸ”¹ What It Is:

* A **large language model (LLM)** trained on a mix of natural language and billions of lines of public source code (mainly from GitHub).
* Powers tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **OpenAIâ€™s API code completions**, and **ChatGPTâ€™s coding features**.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Capabilities:

* Understands both **code and natural language** instructions.
* Can generate code from comments or descriptions.
* Supports **dozens of languages** (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.).
* Handles tasks like **writing functions, suggesting fixes, translating code**, and more.

### ðŸ”¹ How It Works:

* Takes context (code, comments) as input.
* Predicts the next lines of code or full functions.
* Learns patterns, APIs, and idioms from training data.

### ðŸ”¹ Limitations:

* May generate insecure or incorrect code.
* Doesnâ€™t always understand full project context.
* Relies on good prompts and developer oversight.
